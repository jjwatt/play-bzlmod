Example: Bazel with bzlmod & pip extensions

Loosely based on github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/examples/bzlmod

I am trying first with a 3.9 target. Next, I'll try mixed 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, etc.

```
make this work with coverage by adding this to
python.toolchain() configure_coverage_tool = True

bazel coverage //:test
